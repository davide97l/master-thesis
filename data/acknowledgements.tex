I want to thank my supervisor Zhu Jun for the support and guidance he gave me during the realization of this work. In particular, he provided me important feedback about the results that have been obtained and suggested me some interesting experiments to include in my work. I have also to thank Weng Jiayi, the main developer of Tianshou, for his useful discussions about the implementations of the reinforcement learning algorithms and the way to fine-tune their hyper-parameters specifically for the Atari games. Finally, I would like also to thank my family for the support they gave me during these two years at Tsinghua University and all the friends I met on campus for all the fantastic experiences lived together.
